### DEV01-DRAFT-SEARCH-20261009 / 2026-10-09
- **Task:** Continue the authorized connected-mailbox product slice.
- **Authorization:** Existing development-first owner instruction and `docs/project-control/NEXT_ACTION.md` connected-mailbox action.
- **Started from:** GitHub `main`; product change committed as `8ccf1cb24039cb3bc745a51576a73ee68007e946`.
- **Actions:** Recovered repository controls and role boundaries; added Drafts search across subject, body, recipients, and mailbox address, plus a no-match state; recorded central session, lesson, and cross-agent routing.
- **Files/code:** `apps/web/src/app/mail/drafts/drafts-client.tsx`; `docs/project-control/AGENT_SESSIONS.md`; `AGENT_MEMORY.md`; `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`; `AGENT_EVENTS.md`; `NEXT_ACTION.md`.
- **Evidence:** GitHub accepted the source and control-plane updates. No local test, typecheck, build, browser check, runtime migration, provider connection, or deployment verification was executed.
- **Blockers/dependencies:** FIX-01 owns BKL-008 (Drafts tenant context and Inbox SQL search placeholders). Zoho/IMAP provider credentials and live runtime are not available in this session.
- **Lesson:** A source commit is not verification evidence; record only what was actually observed.
- **Next action:** Trace and complete Zoho/IMAP sync persistence, ensure provider-synced drafts appear in Drafts, and wire persisted mail/drafts to authorized Clara tools without waiting for CI/Vercel.
