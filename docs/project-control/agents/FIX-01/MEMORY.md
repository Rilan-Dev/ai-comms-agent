### FIX-01 / Sentinel — 2026-10-09 — Authentication loop re-triage
- **Issue/symptom:** Successful password login at the live HTTP deployment is followed by `/login?reason=not_provisioned`.
- **Root cause:** The current source path no longer matches the original cookie/navigation failure. `reason=not_provisioned` is produced only by the protected root layout after a cookie-bearing request reaches `getAuthenticatedAppContext()` and that context is null. Exact live branch remains unconfirmed because the private runtime is not reachable from this execution environment.
- **Failed approach:** Full browser navigation, explicit cookie propagation in the root layout, and HTTP-aware `Secure` handling are already present on `main` and did not eliminate the live symptom.
- **Remedy:** Route runtime/build/database diagnosis to OPS-01; do not weaken provisioning/auth checks.
- **Prevention:** Treat `login?next=/` and `login?reason=not_provisioned` as different failure branches; inspect cookie presence and application identity/session/membership state before changing login UI again.

### FIX-01-AUTH-FIX-20261009
The authentication loop was traced to session issuance preceding active organization-membership authorization. Fixed `loginWithPassword` to check `getMembershipsForUser(user.id)` and throw `AccountNotProvisionedError` when no active membership exists; the login route returns 403 and does not mint a session. Added auth-boundary regression protection. Commit `197e6535eab0cafde3e84db8f0605b7a174b3b03`. Do not weaken fail-closed authorization or auto-provision memberships.
