# worklog.md — Audit Trail

Append-only audit trail. Every phase and every task records: phase, status, objective, architect, developer, start date, completion date, approved scope, implementation summary, files changed, tests, verification, commit, review result, issues found, corrections, remaining work, next phase, next Z.AI instruction.

Never write "Phase complete" without evidence.

## 2026-10-07 — Clara worker build alias correction

- **Owner:** ChatGPT
- **Scope:** Error-fixing only; no feature development and no project-control documentation changes.
- User ran `bash scripts/manual-up.sh` after the submodule initialization correction. The Docker build now included `vendor/clara`, but the worker image failed during `tsc` because immutable Clara source imports use the Clara repository `@/*` aliases (for example `@/modules/ai-core/factory` and `@/modules/rag/grounding`), while the host worker tsconfig had no path mapping for those aliases.
- Updated `apps/worker/tsconfig.json` with a worker-local `@/*` mapping to `../../vendor/clara/clara-core/source/src/*`. This resolves Clara's internal aliases during the worker compilation without modifying the immutable Clara source.
- **File changed:** `apps/worker/tsconfig.json`.
- **Commit:** `d7a28bf467c939e128f0b9a747420d06274c5a78`.
- No CI/Vercel wait was performed. No Docker build pass is claimed until the user reruns the manual build.


## 2026-10-07 — Clara Docker preflight guard for unresolved host-bound imports

- **Owner:** ChatGPT
- **Scope:** Error-fixing only; no feature development and no project-control documentation changes.
- The next manual Docker build exposed a deeper Clara integration closure problem after submodule initialization: immutable Clara source is now present, but its source graph expects the original Clara host application's `@/lib/*` boundary. The worker also attempts to typecheck that source graph and reports missing host-bound modules plus undeclared external packages. These are not safe to mask with TypeScript suppression because the runtime would still require the missing modules.
- Added `scripts/pre-docker-check.sh` to fail before Docker build when the Clara submodule is absent, host typechecks fail, the known Clara `@/lib/db*` host boundary is unresolved, or manual Compose configuration is invalid.
- The preflight deliberately does not fabricate a DB/auth adapter or alter immutable Clara source. The remaining Clara host-boundary errors therefore stay visible for the existing developer implementation rather than being hidden by a build-only workaround.
- **File changed:** `scripts/pre-docker-check.sh`.
- **Commit:** `fedadbe8133c7f855b5c8d3912007f418209c344`.
- No CI/Vercel wait was performed. No Docker build pass is claimed.
